PS2：Some of the data exceeds 25MB, so it has been compressed. Therefore, it needs to be decompressed before use. Additionally, some of the code does not use relative paths, so you may need to modify them manually.

PS3:
The data in the third assignment are relatively large nc files, so even after overall compression, they may still exceed the limit.
If you need the data for reproduction during grading, you can contact me.
